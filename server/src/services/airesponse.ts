    "question": "What is NestJS, what are its core features, and when might you choose it over a minimalist framework like Express.js for building server-side applications?",
    "answer": "NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and is heavily inspired by Angular's architecture, providing a structured approach.\n\nCore features include:\n*   **Modular Architecture:** Organizes code into reusable modules.\n*   **Dependency Injection:** Manages component dependencies, improving testability and maintainability.\n*   **Decorators:** Provides a clean, declarative way to define routes, services, and components.\n*   **CLI:** Speeds up development with scaffolding and tooling.\n\nYou might choose NestJS over Express.js when:\n*   **Building Large/Complex Applications:** NestJS's structured, opinionated framework makes larger projects more manageable than Express's minimalist approach.\n*   **Requiring Type Safety:** Its TypeScript foundation offers strong typing, reducing errors and enhancing developer experience.\n*   **Prioritizing Scalability and Maintainability:** Designed for enterprise-grade applications, promoting consistency and easier collaboration.\n*   **Seeking Built-in Solutions:** Offers out-of-the-box support for common features like validation, authentication, and GraphQL.",
